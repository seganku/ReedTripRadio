### Description
This is an alternative firmware for wireless 433MHz magnetic door/window reed sensors.  

Boards with STC15W101/104 8051 based processors + SYN115 radio transmitter are supported.  
The '101 model has 1KB flash and the '104 model has 4KB flash.  
Most boards but not all have a tamper detect switch installed.  
 
STC MCUs do not allow read/verify of written firmware.  
Therefore an open source alternative is needed to confirm program behavior.  
Also for this reason original firmware can not be reflashed once overwritten.  

This work is made possible by Vincent Defert's hardware abstraction layer for STC 8051 MCUs:  
https://github.com/area-8051/uni-STC

### Programming Interface
Boards contain a header that may be populated with pins labeled:  
G (ground)  
T (transmit)  
R (receive)  
V (3.3 volts)  

Flashing just requires a 3.3V compatible USB to UART module.  
Alternatively the battery terminal may be powered and only G, T, R pins connected for flashing.  
The board needs fewer than 100 milliamps.  

### Receiver Hardware
Receiving radio packets requires a receiver.

| Sonoff R2 v1.0  | original  | yes | yes | todo |
| Sonoff R2 v1.0  | RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1  | yes | yes | todo |

### Receiver Modifications (optional)

Generic controller with 433 MHz receiver:  
https://github.com/sui77/rc-switch  
Fork that appears more recently updated:  
https://github.com/1technophile/rc-switch


For Sonoff RF Bridge R1/R2 v1.0 and v2.0 modifications are available but are not explicitly required if stock timings are used:  
https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna/wiki/Hardware-Itead-Sonoff-RF-Bridge  
https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-RF-Bridge-433/#rf-firmware-upgrade


RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1 is not supported on Sonoff R2 v2.2 hardware:  
https://github.com/Portisch/RF-Bridge-EFM8BB1/issues/217

However, an effort is underway to provide alternative firmware for the radio decode microcontroller on the Sonoff R2 v2.2 hardware:  
https://github.com/mightymos/RF-Bridge-OB38S003

A hardware modification for R2 v2.2 which bypasses the radio chip so that Tasmota directly decodes is available:  
https://community.home-assistant.io/t/new-sonoff-rf-bridge-board-need-flashing-help/344326/17

### Home automation support (optional)

[ESPurna](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna "ESPurna") is nice because it treats wireless sensors as "virtual" sensors.  
Virtual sensors show up as permanent switch entities in Home Assistant.  
Also ESPurna can learn/remember unique sensor codes.  

[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-RF-Bridge-433/ "Tasmota") firmware can also be flashed.  

ESPHome is also an option (https://github.com/mightymos/ReedTripRadio/issues/11).

### Future plans

As of now, adding more additional features is unlikely.
This is because it was decided to keep firmware under 1KB to support model '101 MCUs/boards.  
It would be possible to add features to the 4KB model '104 MCUs of course.  

One additional possibility is to use emulated EEPROM area on either MCU as code space.  
Experiments with booting from other memory spaces have not worked so far:
